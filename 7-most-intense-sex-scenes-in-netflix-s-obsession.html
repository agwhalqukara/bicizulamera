The doctor makes it obvious to her that he wants to get so close to her that he would read her diary in order to learn everything there is to know about her. The physical intimacy they experience also reflects the closeness he longs for. As Anna fully submits to William’s physical and emotional conquest of her, they play with ropes. He ties her up with the rope to shackle her to him, but in both instances, Anna agrees to her submission.</p><h3>The Blindfold (Season 1 Episode 4)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Blindfold-Season-1-Episode-4-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1260 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Following Jay and Anna’s engagement, William begins to worry more and more about his position in the latter’s life. When the doctor finds it difficult to acknowledge Jay’s presence in the life of his covert girlfriend, the couple gets engaged. But, Anna and William’s sexual connection is further intensified by their engagement. The excitement of keeping Jay in the dark is increasingly enjoyable for the doctor and his lover. One day, Anna greets William while wearing a blindfold over her eyes. The same increases his sense of dominance, which heightens the passion of their sex. The sexual encounter with the blindfold can be considered the pinnacle of their connection, despite the fatal outcomes.</p><h3>The Engagement Party (Season 1 Episode 3)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Engagement-Party-Season-1-Episode-3.jpg alt width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Anna makes it obvious to William that she wants the former when Jay pops the question. While the doctor gives his secret lover permission to say “yes” to his son, William finds it difficult to accept Jay and Anna’s engagement. He worries that Anna won’t give him all he wants, only for her to persuade him that nothing has changed. To show him that he gets what he wants, she submits to him on the grounds of the doctor’s estate. William “celebrates” the engagement by becoming intimate with his lover while his son and other family members do the same.</p><h3>The First Time (Season 1 Episode 1)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-First-Time-Season-1-Episode-1-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1158 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>After their initial encounter, William and Anna immediately feel a spark between them. At their first encounter, they enjoy a certain amount of sexual tension as the doctor lays an olive on her mouth with his bare fingers. When Anna extends an invitation to him to visit her friend Peggy’s flat, the sexual tension reaches its peak. To demonstrate to him that she is open to receiving anything he has to offer, she sprawls down on the ground. Their powerful first sexual encounter together becomes the basis of their relationship.</p><h3>The Rulebreaker (Season 1 Episode 2)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Rulebreaker-Season-1-Episode-2-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1318 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>William finds it difficult to remain apart from Anna once they started having sex. He disappears from his marriage to Ingrid, who begins to question her husband’s behaviour shift. William has been made aware by Anna that they are only allowed to be intimate in Peggy’s flat. When Anna and Jay depart for a weekend of romance in Paris, the doctor forgets the regulations. They have intercourse in the City of Love’s dark streets when William calls and urges her to leave her hotel. Anna cannot stop having sex with William, even if it is on a Parisian street, despite the fact that she doesn’t want him to breach the law.</p><h3>The Surrender (Season 1 Episode 2)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Surrender-Season-1-Episode-2-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1216 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>After sharing a room with the former’s family, William and Anna have their first sexual encounter. They had a passionate first encounter as a result of their shared sexual tension. The second time, they substitute an order for intensity. Anna informs William that she is entirely giving herself over to him. After she submits to him, the doctor begins to prescribe the specifics of their sexual intercourse. The fact that Anna has given in helps William feel in control—not just in front of her but also in front of Jay, who Anna spends the majority of her time with.</p><h3>The Survival (Season 1 Episode 3)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Survival-Season-1-Episode-3-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1203 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>As William and Anna get closer, the former begins to get threatening messages from an unknown number demanding him to confess to having an affair with his family. Anna’s confidence in the secrecy of their encounters is shaken by the communications. Yet she makes the decision to stand her ground. She tells William that their only option is to share each other brutally while having sex in order for her desire and yearning to survive. They tell one other that they will continue with their goals to become one behind closed doors even though the act doesn’t last long.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
