The Kardashian family’s reality show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” served as the launch pad for her career; it provided an intimate look into the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family, and Khloé’s charismatic personality quickly garnered her a substantial following.</p><p>Her reality TV journey extended beyond the main series; she went on to co-star in several spin-off shows, including “Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami” and “Khloé & Lamar” These spin-offs explored different aspects of her life and relationships, providing viewers with deeper insights into her world.[</p><p>Beyond television, Khloé’s diversified her career by venturing into entrepreneurship; with her sisters, she was the co-owner and CEO of the clothing store D-A-S-H, which further solidified her presence in the fashion industry.

Khloé then dated French Montana, a famous rapper; their relationship was relatively brief but still garnered significant media attention.</p><p>It was her relationship with NBA player Tristan Thompson that garnered the most attention; it has had its ups and downs, including allegations of infidelity and several temporary break-ups.
