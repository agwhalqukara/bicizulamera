Dominican MLB pitcher who led the National League in strikeouts as part of the Cincinnati Reds in 2014.&nbsp;After more than seven years with Cincinnati the team, he was transferred for Kansas City Royals in 2015. Kansas City Royals in 2015 and helped the team to win their first World Series Championship.</p><p>He was a part-time pitcher alongside&nbsp;He pitched alongside <a href=#>Bronson Arroyo</a> in the Cincinnati Reds’ rotation.&nbsp;in the Cincinnati Reds’ rotation.</p><p>Cueto began his second season in San Francisco as the Giants #2 starter once again right behind fellow co-ace Bumgarner. On April 4, Cueto made his season debut versus the Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Despite giving up four earned runs on two walks and six hits (two home runs) across five innings, he was able to come away with the win in his season debut. In his outing he notched five strikeouts and helped tremendously with the Giants offense, contributing a single, an RBI and reaching base twice in the Giants 8-4 win. After pitching seven innings of two-run ball against the Rockies on April 14, Cueto became the first Giants pitcher to win his first three starts of the season in back to back years since Rick Reuschel did so in 1988 and 1989.. After revealing he had been suffering a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand since the culmination of spring training, Cueto struck out 10 batters and allowed just two earned runs in seven innings in his second start at Great American Ballpark since leaving the Reds, his fourteenth (fifteenth counting the postseason) double digit strikeout game, and he established the record for the most double digit strikeout games by a pitcher at the stadium (eight). Cueto returned to form on May 28 against the Atlanta Braves, allowing one earned run in six strong innings striking out eight batters, while tacking on a RBI sac fly and a sac bunt at the plate. Cueto then went winless in his next five starts, before posting his sixth victory of the season after allowing two runs in five innings against the Pirates on June 30. He was placed on the DL on July 15 following his first start after the All-Star Break with blisters on his right hand, while later suffering a slight forearm injury in his rehab assignment. At the time he was placed on the DL Cueto was 6-7 with a 4.59 ERA in 115⅔ innings (he had struck out 103), his worst ERA in a single season by that point since he was a rookie in 2008. Cueto finished the season 8-8 with a 4.52 ERA and 1.45 WHIP in ​147 ⁄3 innings (25 starts), striking out 136 batters as the Giants slumped to the worst record in baseball, finishing the season an abysmal 34 games under .500 (64-98).</p><p>Cueto signed in 2004 as an undrafted amateur free agent for a $35,000 signing bonus. He was in the Minor Leagues for three seasons, and has excelled at many levels, but really turned heads during the 2007 season. Cueto started his career for the Gulf Coast Reds of the Rookie Gulf Coast League, posting a 5.02 earned run average (ERA), before being promoted to the High-A Sarasota Reds of the Florida State League, where he finished his 2005 season. Johnny has had progressively better seasons since. In 2006, Cueto was assigned to the Low A Dayton Dragons, posting a 2.61 ERA, and a 0.88 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio. While with Dayton, on May 13, 2006, he threw a rain-shortened no-hitter against Wisconsin. He was later promoted back to Sarasota, where he finished his season for the second consecutive year. In 2007, Cueto was placed, once again, in Sarasota. He pitched 14 games in Sarasota, before going on a hot streak, and advancing through three levels in one season. He played for the AA Chattanooga Lookouts, and AAA Louisville Bats throughout the rest of his 2007 campaign. He was named the Reds’ Minor League Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive season.</p><p align=justify>His birthplace was San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Johnny Cueto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Johnny</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cueto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Pedro de Macorís</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dominican Republic</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jennifer Ruiz</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda Cueto</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Johnny Cueto ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The home runner was the only baserunner he allowed, striking out 10 in 7 innings. Cueto was credited with the win in his debut, as the Reds hung on to win 3–2. Cueto was the first Red since 1900 to throw ten strikeouts in his Major League debut. He was also the first MLB pitcher to have 10 strikeouts and 0 walks in his debut. He was the third in MLB history to have 10 strikeouts and give up only 1 hit. For the game, Cueto’s ERA was 1.29 on 92 pitches. Despite his impressive debut, Cueto was inconsistent for the most part on the season. In his first two starts of the season, Cueto was 1-0 with a 2.02 ERA in ​13 ⁄3 innings with 18 strikeouts, while he went 1-5 in ​43 ⁄3 innings with a 6.65 ERA across his next eight. Cueto struck out several batters in his starts, but found himself unable to pitch himself deep into games rather frequently due to high pitch counts and giving up lots of home runs. At the end of the 2008 campaign, he finished with a 9–14 record with an ERA of 4.81 in 31 starts (14 quality starts). While he pitched only 174 innings, Cueto struck 158 batters (the most of all NL rookies), good for a K/9 ratio of 8.17, the eighth best in the National League.</p><h2>Johnny Cueto Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Johnny Cueto is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from Dominican Republic.

By 2010 though, Cueto began to become a more consistent starting pitcher, and by 2011 he had emerged as the ace of the Reds pitching staff and one of the top pitchers in the National League. He won 19 games and posted a 2.78 ERA in 2012, finishing fourth in the voting for the National League Cy Young Award and helping lead the Reds to the NL Central title. In 2014, he won 20 games with a 2.25 ERA and tied for the NL lead in strikeouts with 242, finishing as the runner up for the Cy Young. In 2016, he won 18 games with the San Francisco Giants while posting a 2.79 ERA, helping lead them to the postseason, where they lost in the NLDS, and achieving another top-10 finish in the Cy Young voting. He was an MLB All-Star in 2014 and 2016, and was chosen as the starting pitcher for the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. From 2011 to 2017, Cueto accumulated the second-lowest ERA of all pitchers with at least 750 innings pitched (behind Clayton Kershaw), managing a 2.94 ERA alongside a 90–51 (.638) record in ​1,256 ⁄3 innings.</p><p>Cueto was a member of the Dominican Republic national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In his only start, an elimination game against Panama, Cueto earned the win after throwing 4⅔ scoreless innings, striking out five against one walk and three hits, the only member of his team to earn a win in the tournament following their elimination in their next game. He missed the tournament in 2013 due to injury. Cueto was scheduled to represent the Dominican Republic once again in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but was unable to attend the opening rounds due to his father falling ill (the Dominican Republic was eliminated in the second round), thus Cueto missed the tournament again.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Johnny Cueto height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Johnny <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cueto started on Opening Day for the Reds and went on to win 19 games against only 9 losses with a 2.78 ERA in 33 starts, giving up 205 hits and 15 home runs across 217 innings and striking out 170 batters, while walking just 49. Cueto established career bests in BB/9 and K/BB ratio with 2.03 and 3.47 respectively, while his 7.05 K/9 ratio was his best since his rookie year in 2008. It was the first time in his career he pitched 200 plus innings in a single season. Cueto also threw two complete games. In his first one, on May 4 against the Pirates, Cueto allowed just one run on seven hits, striking out four and giving up no walks. Cueto threw another complete game against the Cleveland Indians on June 12, giving up just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts and no walks. During an eleven start stretch between May 30 and July 28, Cueto threw ​81 ⁄3 innings without allowing a home run, a stretch in which he posted an 8-3 record with a 2.27 ERA. His streak came to an end on August 2, when Eddy Rodriguez hit a home run off Cueto in a game versus the Brewers. Cueto threw 23 quality starts, and ranked third in wins and ERA, fourth in complete games, fifth in innings pitched, eighth in hits allowed and ninth in winning percentage in the National League, while breaking his career bests in all of those categories.

Cueto gave up four earned runs in six innings in his season debut in a 10-2 loss to the Pirates, despite striking out nine. Over his next three starts, however, Cueto posted a sub 1.00 ERA, allowing just two earned runs in 18 innings. Cueto pitched a career high eight shutout innings on May 3, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out in a 5-0 win over the Pirates. Between April 22 and May 29, Cueto had a nine start span where he pitched at least seven innings and allowed three earned runs or fewer in all but one of those starts. Cueto’s ERA continued to be one of the strongest in the National League through the first three months of the season. On June 14, he took the lead for the lowest NL ERA, with a mark of 2.17 in 87 innings. His BB/9 lowered as the 2009 season progressed. Two weeks before the All-Star game, Cueto was 8-4 with a 2.69 ERA, a major improvement from the previous season. On July 6, 2009, Cueto suffered the worst defeat in his young career. Taking the mound against the Phillies, he allowed nine earned runs on five hits, walking three. To top it off, all this happened in the first inning, and Cueto was taken out of the game after only recording two outs. The Phillies scored 10 runs that inning. Cueto struggled following that defeat, turning in a 5.91 ERA over his final 13 starts while only managing a 3-6 record, although the final six starts (3-1 with a 3.63 ERA) were more promising. Cueto finished the season with a record of 11–11, and an ERA of 4.41 in 30 starts. In ​171 ⁄3 innings, Cueto struck out 132 batters and walked 61 batters, which despite a lower BB/9 ratio (3.20 versus 3.52) resulted in a lower K/BB ratio than his rookie season (2.32 versus 2.16) due to a decrease in strikeouts per nine innings (6.93 versus 8.17).</p><h2>Top Facts about Johnny Cueto</h2><li>Johnny Cueto is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher.</li><li>He was born on February 15, 1986 in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic.</li><li>Cueto made his MLB debut with the Cincinnati Reds in 2008.</li><li>He has played for four different teams throughout his career.</li><li>Cueto is a two-time All-Star and won the NL ERA title in 2014.</li><li>His career ERA is 3.43 and he has over 1,700 strikeouts.</li><li>Cueto helped lead the Kansas City Royals to a World Series championship in 2015.</li><li>He has also represented the Dominican Republic in international play, winning a gold medal at the 2013 World Baseball Classic.</li><li>Injuries have limited his playing time in recent years.</li><li>Despite this, Cueto remains one of the most talented pitchers from the Dominican Republic.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Johnny Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Baseball Player</strong>.
