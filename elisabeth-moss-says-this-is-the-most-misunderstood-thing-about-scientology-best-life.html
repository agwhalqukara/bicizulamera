Ron Hubbard</strong>, and is notorious outside of the group for a few things. For one, there's a definite Hollywood connection, with <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>, <strong>John Travolta</strong>, and Moss among the religion's high-profile practicing members. For another, many believe that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Scientology is abusive</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>punitive</a>, and otherwise problematic. Some ex-members claim to have faced retaliation for leaving or speaking out against the church, as well as maintain that members are forced to "disconnect" from friends and family who are not supportive of their involvement. "I was in a cult for 34 years," screenwriter and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>ex-Scientologist&nbsp;</a><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Paul Haggis</a>&nbsp;</strong>told The New Yorker (via The Guardian) in 2011.

"One of the things I believe in is freedom of speech. I believe we as humans should be able to critique things. I believe in freedom of the press. I believe in people being able to speak their own opinions. I don't ever want to take that away from anybody, because that actually is very important to me. At the same time, I should hope that people educate themselves for themselves and form their own opinion, as I have. The things that I believe in personally, for me, The Handmaid's Tale, and the ability to do something that is artistically fulfilling but is also personally fulfilling, I've never had that. The Handmaid's Tale lines up so perfectly parallel with my own beliefs in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the things that this country was actually built on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Elisabeth-Moss-in-2020-2.jpg><p>The New Yorker&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>recently profiled Moss</a> and chronicled how she was born into Scientology—and how it basically started her career. The actor's father,&nbsp;<strong>Ron Moss</strong>, met musician&nbsp;<strong>Chick Corea&nbsp;</strong>at a Scientology center in England. They hit it off, Ron became Corea's manager, and Corea became Moss' godfather after she was born. A dancer before she was an actor, She performed in one of Corea's music videos when she was just five years old.&nbsp;The New Yorker&nbsp;also noted that Ron played in a band with <strong>Ron Miscavige</strong>, the late father of Scientology's now-leader <strong>David Miscavige</strong>. Before Ron Miscavige died, he left the church and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>wrote a book about the experience</a>, in which he alleges that his son was surveilling him, among other troubling things that the church denies.</p><p>According to the publication, Moss began taking Scientology courses when she was eight years old.</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Elisabeth-Moss-in-2019.jpg><p>When asked by&nbsp;The New Yorker&nbsp;about her long-held beliefs, Moss said she didn't "want to come off as being cagey," but also didn't "want people to be distracted by something when they're watching [her]."</p><p>"People can obviously hold in their mind whatever they want to, and I can't control that," she went on, after being reminded that lots of people watching her know she's a Scientologist already. "If it's not that, it's going to be something else. It's not really a closed-off religion. It's a place that is very open to, like, welcoming in somebody who wants to learn more about it. I think that's the thing that is probably the most misunderstood."</p><p>The New Yorker&nbsp;reports that Moss said,&nbsp;"I would just encourage people to find out for themselves" of the religion more than once during the interview. "I've certainly been guilty of reading an article or watching something and taking that as gospel." Some critics of Scientology have pointed out <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Moss' answer is strikingly similar</a> to the answers given by other celebrity Scientologists in past interviews.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Moment Michelle Pfeiffer Realized She Was "In a Cult."</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnqSZqK6jsdOhZKano6h6tK%2FInqWtp5yktLp5zKKqrqaUmr%2B0wM6om2amlazAcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./james-gandolfini-s-death-and-the-hidden-struggles-behind-it.html>&#171;&nbsp;James Gandolfini's Death And The Hidden Struggles Behind It</a>
