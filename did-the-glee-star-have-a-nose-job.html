People are curious if she underwent the knife&nbsp;to improve her appearance.</strong></p><p><strong>Lea Michele Sarfati</strong> (b. August 29, 1986) is an <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>actress</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>singer</a></strong>, songwriter, and author from the United States. She began her Broadway career as a child actress, appearing in Les Misérables, Ragtime, Fiddler on the Roof, and Spring Awakening.</p><p>Michele rose to fame as Rachel Berry on Fox's Glee, for which she received an Emmy Award nomination, two Golden Globe nominations, four People's Choice Awards, three Teen Choice Awards, and a Satellite Award. She went on to star in the Fox series Scream Queens and the ABC sitcom The Mayor.</p><p>Cannonball, her debut single, was followed by Louder, her debut studio album, which debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Similarly, Places, her second studio album, debuted at number 28 on the Billboard 200 three years later. Her third studio album, Christmas in the City, was released in 2019. Michele has also written two books: Brunette Ambition and You First: Journal Your Way to a Better Life.</p><p>On the other hand, her plastic surgery has also been a popular topic on the internet recently. But did she have any surgery? Is her beauty entirely natural? If so, what surgical enhancements has she had? Find out everything you need to know about Lea Michele's plastic surgery.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Dove Cameron</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jane Fonda</a></strong>.</p><h2>Lea Michele’s Plastic Surgery: The Glee Actress Never Had a Nose Job!</h2><p><strong>Lea Michele&nbsp;</strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@leahmichele</a>) has grown up a lot since her childhood. Her beauty transformation has been a public thing to address, despite her portraying several incredible roles in movies and series. People have spread rumors about the star's plastic surgery due to a few changes in her appearance.</p><p>When comparing her photos from the past to the present, there is no discernible difference in her appearance. When Michele was 15 years old and starting her Broadway career, her manager advised her to get a nose job, a procedure that almost every girl in her high school had undergone. Leah Michele, on the other hand, has proven them wrong with her natural beauty by not having plastic surgery.</p><p>The 36-year-old actress also stated that her mother always encouraged her not to have plastic surgery. This demonstrates that the actress did not complete the task to some extent. However, some minor differences do not support her statement, leading to such rumors.</p><p>Fans are always curious about her beauty secrets, but it's difficult to tell if it's due to makeup or plastic surgery. The rumors first surfaced in the news in 2011, when her nose shrank in size compared to <a href=# rel=noopener>before</a>. The actress also received the best products, which may have resulted in some differences between the actresses.</p><p>Similarly, the Glee star's style has evolved numerous times since her previous appearances. They have also had a minor impact on her appearance. When comparing her before and after pictures, she has also shed her cheek skin, which has had dramatic results. As a result, plastic surgery experts have speculated that the actress may have undergone surgical enhancements.</p><p>The songwriter is also proud to be on a positive show and a voice for women. She believes that you don't have to look like everyone else to be happy with yourself. This demonstrates her opposition to plastic surgery, and she may have accepted her true self rather than undergoing any procedure.</p><p>Lea Michele was always aware of how other people perceived her, which is why, prior to Glee, she never dared to dream of seeing herself on television, on magazine covers, or as the face of beauty campaigns. That all changed when she rose to fame and became a trailblazer for unique beauty on screen.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><h2>Meet Lea Michele’s Husband, Zandy Reich!</h2><p><strong>Lea Michele</strong> announced her engagement to <strong>Zandy Reich</strong> on April 28, 2018.&nbsp;On March 9, 2019, she <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> Zandy in Napa, California.
