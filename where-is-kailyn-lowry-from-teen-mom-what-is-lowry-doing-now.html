Born on March 14, 1992, Kailyn is currently 27 years of age. Her mother, Suzanne Irwin, raised her.</p><p>While her high school is unknown, we assume that she attended a local school at Honesdale. In Contrast, we know Kailyn graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mass communications from Delaware State University in the year 2017. It is unknown if she graduated high school or not, but she definitely got some certification to join college.</p><p>Kailyn got pregnant for the first time when she was only 16 years old while in high school. Her family was against the pregnancy, and the boyfriend also bailed out. Consequently, Kailyn aborted the child unwillingly. But a year later, she got pregnant again at the age of 17.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dating_Life_with_Second_Baby_Daddy_%E2%80%98Jo_Rivera></span>Dating Life with Second Baby Daddy ‘Jo’ Rivera<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the name of the first boy who impregnated her when she was 16 is a secret, father to her second pregnancy is Jonathan ‘Jo’ Rivera. At age 17, Kaylin got impregnated by her then-boyfriend Jonathan. Kaylin, against her family’s will, decided to keep the child and gave birth to her first son on January 18, 2010.</p><p>Kaylin had moved out of her house due to her family, not supporting her decision.
